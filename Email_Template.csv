25,,,A few other experiments you can run to grow your email list,"Hey {name}, Been a huge fan of your site since it first went up. Noticed you've been running several experiments to grow your email lists. Here are a few lesser-used strategies that drive explosive growth: - Members only bonus area: You offer a lot of juicy bonuses to entice new signups. There doesn't seem to be a way for existing members to also receive them right now. Think creating a members-only bonus area where existing subscribers can go to download your latest goodies would go long ways to build their long-term loyalty.- Behavior settings on your opt-in box: Noticed your opt-in box still pops up for people who already subscribed. You can use a much longer-lasting cookie to stop it from annoying your existing subscribers. I've been coding for the last several years with a focus on building viral growth engines. I recently coded all the backend for RoyalSee's pre-launch campaign: [link]. They got 10K signups in 2 weeks. Happy to lend a hand with future projects - let me know what you think."

28,,,,"I noticed on your website that XYZ is a customer. Congrats on getting traction with such an established brand, which is undeniably no small feat for an early-stage startup. I know from speaking with other founders that many, if not all, find it challenging to developing a repeatable selling process in a way that feels natural, comfortable, and authentic without sounding “salesy”. The impact – inaction. Lack of a predictable pipeline and sales. In the past year, we’ve worked with companies like ABC and def to help them close more deals in less time without selling their soul and was thinking we might be able to help XYZ in this area as well. I’m not sure if this is a fit for you folks, but if you’d like to learn more would you be open to carving out some time to explore? Alternate ending: If you’d like I can send you a 2 minute demo so you can evaluate."
29,,,"{name}, is your marketing automation tool working for you?","Hi {name}, I understand you may currently be using Pardot as a marketing tool, and I was wondering if you’re experiencing any difficulty with it. Pardot users often find that they need a more scalable solution as their business grows, and as a result, we’ve seen many customers switch to Marketo in recent months. These customers see immediate increases of 30-100% in productivity and a dramatic increase in leads – purely because they get much more capability in an easier-to-use package. Why are Pardot users switching? Marketo removes the limitations that held them back – some of the major benefits that these customers have experienced with Marketo include: A much more productive, intuitive, and flexible interface for creating marketing campaigns (ranked #1 for user experience by independent analysts) Ability to quickly report on pipeline, revenue, and ROI by a marketing campaign or channel Flexible lead scoring – which includes scoring models by product line or division, and automatic score reductions when your leads are inactive Drastically improved ability to leverage lead intelligence solutions inside your CRM For a limited time, we are also offering special pricing packages to make switching incredibly easy and attractive. Please reply to this email or click here if you’d like to set up a time to talk about whether Marketo makes sense for your business. Or, learn more here."

38,,,5 Ideas for Starbucks using Twilio,"Hi {name}, After sending my last email, I got really excited and wanted to share some ideas I had on how Starbucks could leverage Twilio: 

Mobile app distribution - reduce friction by allowing your website visitors to download your mobile app by texting the download link to their phone. Our technology intelligently detects whether a phone is on iOS or Android OS and sends them to the right app store.
Picture message a coupon to your customers on their birthday. Why tell them how good a frap will be when you can show them the gooey ribbons of caramel?
New VIP service: text your order in to your local Starbucks. Get your favorite thirst quencher sooner.
Picture message Starbucks coupons w/QR codes to your friends on special occasions.
Leverage geo-location services to MMS special deals to customers when they are in close vicinity to a Starbucks.

70,,,Subject: Re: demo follow up,"No worries... the short answer is no, we aren't able to compete on price against FooCorp.The FooCorps of the world have spent a couple of decades now in a race to the bottom and it shows. I have no doubt you can get their product (or a whole raft of others) for a few bucks cheaper than us.Our product, Acme, is different. We're designed to help improve your company's performance in the critical area of XYZ. The ROI on doing that is enormous.Now, not every organization sees the value in investing in XYZ. I get that. But if yours does, Acme is one of the most leveraged investments you can make.Assume HelloSign does 5-6 transactions in the [XYZ field], that's going to run 300-600k per year (so figure this is a $1-2MM investment over 3 years). The value of each transaction will be maybe 2-5x that if they're done well, whereas a bad one we know can actually destroy value.On the cost side, great transactions churn over at less than half the rate of low-performing ones - which means if you do a better job at XYZ, you'll save 10's of thousands in new transaction costs as they stay longer. And on and on....So ultimately if you think Acme will help you do this better - even just a little bit - the whole thing is peanuts. The cost difference between our product and the others, even less.Look, FooCorp's customers are switching to Acme in droves because we're investing heavily in great customer service and innovation.
